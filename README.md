### A Python SDK for Cisco SD-WAN vManage API

This is supposed to be a wrapper around Cisco's vManage API. There's a similar solution provided by Cisco and can be accessed [here](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/python-viptela)


* #### Why another solution?
    It's a great way to learn new things by building things.

* #### Is it completed or a work-in-progress project?
    This started as a hobby project and still in progress. 
   
* #### How can I use this?
    A How-To document will be available after phase-1, which is implementing all the API endpoints, is completed.

* #### Contributions?
    Highly appreciated and welcome.
    

All Endpoints in vManage API are implemented using the vmanage.json file available through vmanage/apidocs page as a reference
